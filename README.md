This project will be the landing page of steflabs.co

It has a dynamic content management system where it watches for changes in the "content" folder, weather that be changes or additional files and servers them using the template system

- [ ] Make the go server watch for changes as a background process and still run the server

For the templating system since I refuse to use JS
and I find tailwind to be generally a nightmare to work with

I will be using Templ for server side components and daisy UI
For the styling
